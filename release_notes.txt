* Up to 10 Hz GPS L1/L2 RTK Operation
* Low Latency and Time Matched RTK modes
* Up to 200 Hz IMU raw data output
* UART (two ports), USB (host and device), Ethernet interfaces
* Swift Binary (SBP) and NMEA0183 protocols
* Status LEDs (Power, Position, Link, Mode)
* Active antenna supply control
* Antenna input selection
* External event trigger input (rising, falling or both edges)

KNOWN ISSUES:
* [286] SBAS is not implemented. Changing SBAS settings has no effect.
* [278] The USB device data buffer does not flush on new connection. As a result stale data is sometimes
  transmitted after a new connection is made.
* [233] NMEA messages may provide incorrect UTC time at start before the first fix.
* [235] NMEA GGA message rate is not configurable. It is always output at a solution rate.
* [269] NMEA protocol is not available on USB interface.
* [234] NMEA GSA message reports tracked SVs instead of used SVs.
* [274] NMEA GSV message reports used SVs instead of visible SVs and is sent only when fix is available.
* [252] 1 PPS output is still generated after fix is lost.
* [287] Incoming RTK corrections are echoed on the same port. It can create additional data traffic over the radio.
* [283] SBP messages MSG_UTC_TIME, MSG_DGPS_STATUS, MSG_AGE_CORRECTIONS are not yet implemented.
* [230] Ethernet port LED does not show activity during communication.
* [227] LED indicators may show incorrect status during reset.
* [282] External event input has no debouncing. A sharp input edges are required to avoid multiple messages with
  the same time tag.

NOTES:
* Corresponding Swift Console version: 1.0.A.
