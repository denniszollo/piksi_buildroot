Release 1.1.27                                                       2017-05-17
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES AND UPDATES:
* Improved general navigation performance and system stability.
* Low Latency (max 20 Hz) and Time Matched (max 5 Hz) RTK modes 
* RTCMv3 messages input added.
* On-board NTRIP client added.
* Onboard standalone data logging feature added.
* SBP and NMEA RTK heading output messages added.
* Heading offset setting added.
* Protocol mode selection added to USB and Ethernet TCP/IP interfaces.
* UART flow control added.
* GPS time and velocity output added to the simulator.
* UTC offset decoding added.
* Observation data now compatible with Swift's Rinex converter (sbp2rinex)
* Observation data now compatiable with common post-processing tools.
* Accelerometer default range setting changed to 8g.

EXISTING FEATURES:
* GPS L1CA/L2C RTK Operation
* Up to 200 Hz IMU raw data output
* UART (two ports w/ optional flow control), USB (host and device), Ethernet interfaces
* Swift Binary (SBP), NMEA0183 and RTCMv3 protocols 
* Status LEDs (Power, Position, Link, Mode)
* Active antenna supply control
* External event trigger input (rising, falling or both edges)
* 1 Pulse Per Second (PPS) output
* Position Valid (PV) digital output
* Surveyed position lat/lon/alt and all settings non-volatile storage
* Simulator option

BUG FIXES:
* [286] Not operational SBAS settings have been removed.
* [278] USB device data buffer now flushes on new connection.
* [233] NMEA messages time is provided only when fix is valid.
* [235] NMEA GGA message rate is now configurable.
* [269] USB interface NMEA mode selection added.
* [234] NMEA GSA message reports used SVs.
* [274] NMEA GSV message reports visible SVs.
* [282] External event input has software debouncing to avoid multiple messages
* [283] SBP messages MSG_UTC_TIME, MSG_DGPS_STATUS, MSG_AGE_CORRECTIONS have been implemented.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* [252] 1 PPS output is generated after fix is lost.
* [287] Incoming RTK corrections are echoed on the same port. It can create additional data traffic over the radio.
* [230] Ethernet port LED does not show activity during communication.
* [227] LED indicators may show incorrect status during reset.
* [422] Missed solution epochs and stability issues when high numbers of tracking channels (i.e > 22) in use
* [465] A sharp input edges is required to avoid "Too many external events" Nap Error message

NOTES:
* Corresponding Swift Console version: 1.1.G.
* Supported RTCMv3 messages: 1002, 1004, 1005, 1006.

Release 1.0.11  (Initial Release)                                    2017-02-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES:
* Up to 10 Hz GPS L1/L2 RTK Operation
* Low Latency and Time Matched RTK modes
* Up to 200 Hz IMU raw data output
* UART (two ports), USB (host and device), Ethernet interfaces
* Swift Binary (SBP) and NMEA0183 protocols
* Status LEDs (Power, Position, Link, Mode)
* Active antenna supply control
* Antenna input selection
* External event trigger input (rising, falling or both edges)
* 1 Pulse Per Second (PPS) output
* Position Valid (PV) digital output
* Surveyed position lat/lon/alt and all settings non-volatile storage
* Simulator option

KNOWN ISSUES:
* [286] SBAS is not implemented. Changing SBAS settings has no effect.
* [278] The USB device data buffer does not flush on new connection. As a result stale data is sometimes
  transmitted after a new connection is made.
* [233] NMEA messages may provide incorrect UTC time at start before the first fix.
* [235] NMEA GGA message rate is not configurable. It is always output at a solution rate.
* [269] NMEA protocol is not available on USB interface.
* [234] NMEA GSA message reports tracked SVs instead of used SVs.
* [274] NMEA GSV message reports used SVs instead of visible SVs and is sent only when fix is available.
* [252] 1 PPS output is still generated after fix is lost.
* [287] Incoming RTK corrections are echoed on the same port. It can create additional data traffic over the radio.
* [283] SBP messages MSG_UTC_TIME, MSG_DGPS_STATUS, MSG_AGE_CORRECTIONS are not yet implemented.
* [230] Ethernet port LED does not show activity during communication.
* [227] LED indicators may show incorrect status during reset.
* [282] External event input has no debouncing. A sharp input edges are required to avoid multiple messages with
  the same time tag.

NOTES:
* Corresponding Swift Console version: 1.0.A.
